# Anomic-Revamp-aka-Anomic-v2-

||| OP OP Gun Script Anomic v2 v0.1 (19/02/22) .. Update #1
-------
Main Features:
- Silent Aim
- Instant Kill
- Auto Reload
- Anti Dumb Camera

Extra Info:
+ Most of the features are similar to OP OP Gun script for Anomic v1
+ Instant Kill is as strong as the one in Anomic v1
+ Auto Reload follows the same concept as the other Anomic v1 well too lazy to explain
+ Silent Aim will now ignore targets sitting in a car unless you break its window such that Silent Aim can detect the target through the gap. Well, I did some testing pretty sure you can't kill someone standing behind a car.
+ Anti Dumb Camera basically disables the toxic camera lock for guns so you can enjoy them like Anomic v1

+ There will be some settings that you can adjust before executing the script

System.IsSilentAimEnabled = true -- true = SilentAim enabled || false = SilenAim disabled

System.IsInstantKillEnabled = true -- true = InstantKill enabled || false = InstantKill disabled



Note 1. Anomic v2 was really boring so I didn't do much testing I'll wait for you guys to do that instead and I will only update the script once or twice because I need to focus on my project from now

Note 2. This script is open source so feel free to read and learn just don't sell it please its a free script plus I'll release the source of Anomic v1 in a few days

Note 3. Honestly, Anomic v2 has tons of bugs so it was super annoying to make op op gun that works on it. The game needs to be improved a lot idk if you have ever noticed the CPU usage devs probably don't know how their game is even working else these issues can easily be resolved more like they just add whatever looks or feel cool without knowing how to script it properly
